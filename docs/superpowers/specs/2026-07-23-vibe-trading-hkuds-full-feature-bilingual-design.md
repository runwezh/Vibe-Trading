# Vibe-Trading HKUDS Full-Feature Bilingual Deck — Design Specification

**Date:** 2026-07-23
**Status:** Approved for direct implementation by the user's instruction to start without further questions
**Deliverables:** one Chinese `.pptx` and one English `.pptx`, with one-to-one slide mapping

## 1. Objective

Create a comprehensive Vibe-Trading presentation that explains the complete product rather than centering only on the trust layer. The deck must reuse the current HKUDS presentation base: white canvas, official HKU bilingual logo, red header rule, restrained editorial illustration language, editable upper-left title, editable one-line caption, and detailed speaker notes.

The narrative is problem-led. Every major capability is presented as a complete problem-solving unit:

1. **Motivation** — why this capability is needed;
2. **Challenges** — what makes the problem hard;
3. **Solution** — how Vibe-Trading addresses the hard parts;
4. **Outcome** — what the user receives or can do next.

This requirement applies to every capability slide. The result must not read as a feature inventory.

## 2. Source of Truth and Content Policy

- Use the current local `README.md` and `README_zh.md` in this checkout as the primary public-product source.
- Use the checked-in project `AGENTS.md` only to resolve architecture and safety details already reflected in the product.
- Do not browse, pull, or substitute remote README content.
- Keep the public headline numbers used by the existing Chinese deck and the user's explicit direction:
  - 88 finance skills across 9 categories;
  - 462 alphas across 5 families;
  - 23 data sources;
  - 30 swarm presets;
  - 18 read-only data tools;
  - 8 backtest engines plus options portfolio;
  - 15 metrics, 5 optimizers, 3 validation tools;
  - 12 broker connectors;
  - 54 MCP tools;
  - 16 IM adapters.
- Do not mention paid data, premium data, marketplace credits, referral links, or QVeris anywhere in slide text, body images, captions, speaker notes, or PDF exports.
- Planned roadmap items must be visually and verbally separated from shipped functionality.
- Do not claim custody, execution-venue status, or unrestricted live trading.

## 3. Existing Files and Non-Destructive Rule

Use the following as read-only references:

- Short Chinese HKUDS deck: `Vibe-Trading_HKUDS_Presentation_CN_2026-07-23.pptx`
- Short English HKUDS deck: `Vibe-Trading_HKUDS_Presentation_EN_2026-07-23.pptx`
- Earlier Chinese full-feature master: `Vibe-Trading中文母版_全功能版_2026-07-22.pptx`
- User-provided template deck: `自制.pptx`

The new files are siblings; no existing presentation or source image is overwritten.

## 4. Output Names

- `Vibe-Trading_HKUDS_Full-Feature_Presentation_CN_2026-07-23.pptx`
- `Vibe-Trading_HKUDS_Full-Feature_Presentation_EN_2026-07-23.pptx`

Both files live in:

`/Users/wuhaozhe/Desktop/hkuds/vibe trading ppt/中文母版/`

## 5. Slide Architecture

The deck contains 34 slides. Slides 1–4 establish the system-level story; slides 5–32 cover individual capability domains; slides 33–34 close with adoption and roadmap. Chinese and English slides use identical ordering and geometry.

## 6. Per-Slide Narrative Contract

Every capability slide uses four content zones inside the body image:

- **Motivation / 为什么需要** — one audience-facing problem statement;
- **Challenges / 难在哪里** — two or three concrete constraints;
- **Solution / 怎么解决** — two to four concrete mechanisms already present in the repository;
- **Outcome / 交付什么** — a short outcome strip describing the inspectable deliverable.

The slide title names the problem solved, not merely the module. A small source footer reads `Local README · v0.1.12 · 2026-07-23` or its Chinese equivalent. The footer is part of the body image and never contains a remote or paid-data reference.

## 7. Visual System

### 7.1 Baseboard

- Canvas: 16:9, 10 × 5.625 inches, inherited from the current HKUDS short deck.
- Background: white / warm white.
- Official HKU bilingual logo: inherited from the existing slide layout without alteration.
- Header rule: inherited red rule with existing accent segment.
- Title: upper-left, editable, dark HKU red, smaller than the earliest drafts, single line wherever possible.
- Caption: editable one-line text block under the image.

### 7.2 Body Image

- 1902 × 827 PNG, placed with the same geometry as the current short deck.
- The six-slide short deck is the visual-quality floor. Each capability receives a bespoke image-generation illustration, not a repeated three-column card template.
- Restrained editorial-infographic style:
  - dark brown hand-drawn line work;
  - muted sage;
  - dusty rose;
  - HKU red accents;
  - warm white background and generous whitespace.
- Every illustration communicates Motivation → Challenges → Solution as one integrated visual sequence using scenes, objects, paths, barriers, and resolved evidence. It must not look like a generic dashboard or a slide full of boxes.
- Images contain no words, letters, numbers, logo, title, watermark, or fabricated interface text. This preserves language accuracy and lets the same polished visual logic serve both language versions.
- Chinese and English decks separately compose the body with the illustration plus native editable language-specific text. The one-line text block under each image explicitly names Motivation, Challenges, and Solution; speaker notes expand all three and the Outcome.
- Reuse the visual grammar of the existing short deck—fine connectors, simple characters and research objects, restrained cards and folders, and evidence-oriented storytelling—while creating new scenes for every slide.

## 8. Bilingual Mapping

- Chinese and English decks have the same 34 slides, same body-image dimensions, same placements, and same notes-paragraph counts.
- English is written for an international technical/product audience, not word-for-word Chinese syntax.
- Chinese terminology favors audience-facing language over literal translations. Examples:
  - grounding → “证据接入” or “材料进入研究上下文,” not “取证” when that would sound legalistic;
  - links → “关联记录 / 运行关联,” not generic “链接” when the relation is semantic;
  - run card → “运行卡片 / 研究运行记录,” with the English term kept only where useful.
- Product and protocol names remain in English where that improves precision: Agent Runtime, Swarm, Alpha Zoo, MCP, Shadow Account, Data Bridge.

## 9. Speaker Notes

- Cover: two paragraphs.
- Slides 2–34: three paragraphs each.
- Paragraph 1 explains motivation, paragraph 2 explains the hard constraints, and paragraph 3 explains the Vibe-Trading mechanisms and resulting deliverable.
- Notes are detailed enough for roughly 45–75 seconds of speaking per slide.
- Notes use the same language as the deck and contain no paid-data references.

## 10. Verification Gates

1. 34 slides in both files; same ordering and language-neutral geometry.
2. Exact paired filenames; existing short decks remain byte-identical.
3. One bespoke body illustration, one native title, and one native editable Motivation/Challenges/Solution caption per slide.
4. Speaker notes: 2 paragraphs on cover, 3 paragraphs elsewhere.
5. English native text and notes contain no CJK characters; the official HKU logo is the only bilingual graphic.
6. Forbidden-term scan across slide XML, notes XML, and image-source contract.
7. Required headline-number scan: 88, 462, 23, 30, 18, 8, 15, 5, 3, 12, 54, 16.
8. Office Open XML validation and ZIP integrity.
9. LibreOffice PDF render and full-resolution slide PNGs.
10. Programmatic image-bound checks and independent visual QA with blocker/major/minor classification.
11. Final revalidation of the previous English short deck alongside the new full-feature pair.
